## Assignment {.unnumbered}
looking ahead

In class, we discussed this assignment yesterday. In the following weeks, start looking for what you will want to spend your extra time on this semester.

Try, for yourself, to answer the following questions:

- Where do I want to be in ~2 years time?<br>
- How am I doing now with respect to this goal?<br>
- What would be the next skill to learn?<br>

Make a planning on how to start learning this new skill.<br>

Note the following points:

- It has to be life sciences or useful for life sciences (no knitting, riding horses etc)<br>
- It has to be data science / bioinformatics<br>
- You have to show your plan in your portfolio, together with the result of the first few steps you took in trying to rech this goal.<br>
- You probably wonâ€™t learn this skill in a few days. Just get started.<br>

This assignment will show us whether you succeeded in reaching an overview of the field and possibilities in data science for biology.
