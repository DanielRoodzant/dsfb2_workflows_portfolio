Assignment {.unnumbered}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
looking ahead

In class, we discussed this assignment yesterday. In the following weeks, start looking for what you will want to spend your extra time on this semester.

Try, for yourself, to answer the following questions:

- Where do I want to be in ~2 years time?<br>
- How am I doing now with respect to this goal?<br>
- What would be the next skill to learn?<br>

Make a planning on how to start learning this new skill.<br>

Note the following points:

- It has to be life sciences or useful for life sciences (no knitting, riding horses etc)<br>
- It has to be data science / bioinformatics<br>
- You have to show your plan in your portfolio, together with the result of the first few steps you took in trying to rech this goal.<br>
- You probably wonâ€™t learn this skill in a few days. Just get started.<br>

This assignment will show us whether you succeeded in reaching an overview of the field and possibilities in data science for biology.

My plan {.unnumbered}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In 2 years time I want to be working as a data scientist for a research group most preferably in the field of genomics or proteomics. This minor program is my first big step and also my first big inspiration in regards to bioinformatics and data science. <br>
The next skill for me to learn would be expanding my coding knowledge wherever necessary. I will start this by getting online certificates through the [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) platform. Here, institutes like universities but also Google and IBM offer courses, certificate programs and degrees in a number of fields including data science. <br>
There is a number of certificates you can get free of charge that will be a nice touch on your resume and a big step forward in you coding or data science career. In this process I would also like to learn Python and some more HTML.
