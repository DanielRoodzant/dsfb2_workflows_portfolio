# Looking ahead 

In 2 years time I want to be working as a data scientist specializing in data engineering. My first big step and also my first big inspiration in regards to bioinformatics and data science is creating this digital portfolio as a result of the minor Data Science For Biology at the University of Applied Science Utrecht. The project for the PMC where I created an R-Shiny dashboard awakened an interest in data engineering, development of software and scriptwriting. 
<br> <br>
The next skill for me to learn would be expanding my coding knowledge wherever necessary. I have already started this by getting online certificates through the [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) platform. Here, institutes like universities but also Google and IBM offer courses, certificate programs and degrees in a number of fields including data science. 
<br><br>
One of the courses I participated in is the [Genomic Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/genomic-data-science?action=enroll) specialization including 8 courses covering genomic data science tools, working with Python for genomics and algorithms. 
<br> <br> 
After signing up Coursera grants you acces to pages containing videos, readings and quizzes divided into weeks with an average workload of 1-2 hours. <br>

<br>
Upon completion of the course and after taking some exams you are presented with a certificate. <br>
