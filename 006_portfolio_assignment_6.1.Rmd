github pages

Execute the steps explained here (click) to setup a github-pages repository called myname-portfolio or something similar.
Once you have successfully rendered your bookdown to a full website, hosting can be achieved by copying all html files to your Github-pages. The easiest way is to:

1. clone your github pages repo <br>
2. copy all the html files rendered with bookdown to this folder<br>
3. commit and push all changes to your github pages repo. The website will be automatically updated after some time.<br>

You can also setup a theme for your github pages. See here for more info, but you have learned to use css, so this is a nice opportunity to display that.

- Put your portfolio on your github pages<br>
- Send the url to your public portfolio address on the “prikbord” channel.
