github pages

Execute the steps explained here (click) to setup a github-pages repository called myname-portfolio or something similar.
Once you have successfully rendered your bookdown to a full website, hosting can be achieved by copying all html files to your Github-pages. The easiest way is to:

clone your github pages repo
copy all the html files rendered with bookdown to this folder
commit and push all changes to your github pages repo. The website will be automatically updated after some time.
You can also setup a theme for your github pages. See here for more info, but you have learned to use css, so this is a nice opportunity to display that.

Put your portfolio on your github pages
Send the url to your public portfolio address on the “prikbord” channel.
