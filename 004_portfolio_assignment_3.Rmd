## Assignment {.unnumbered}
Start your portfolio with a CV

__A__
Create a Git repository on GitHub for your portfolio.
Subsequently, clone the GitHub repository to your computer. Copy paste your portfolio-Rmd-files to this folder. You will see the new files showing up in the “git” window in the upper right of the screen in Rstudio. Commit/push the changes to your repo.

__B__
Now start building your CV in a new Rmarkdown file and keep using github for version control. Remember to commit often, and push your changes! Build something that you would want to send to a possible future bioinformatics internship position, or when job hunting. So it needs to be complete and professional looking.
You can look around online for examples of cv’s (/resume). Your cv will be part of your portfolio.
