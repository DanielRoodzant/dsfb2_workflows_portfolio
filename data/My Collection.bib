abstract = {Base editing induces single-nucleotide changes in the DNA of living cells using a fusion protein containing a catalytically defective Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9, a cytidine deaminase, and an inhibitor of base excision repair. This genome editing approach has the advantage that it does not require formation of double-stranded DNA breaks or provision of a donor DNA template. Here we report the development of five C to T (or G to A) base editors that use natural and engineered Cas9 variants with different protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) specificities to expand the number of sites that can be targeted by base editing 2.5-fold. Additionally, we engineered base editors containing mutated cytidine deaminase domains that narrow the width of the editing window from ∼5 nucleotides to as little as 1-2 nucleotides. We thereby enabled discrimination of neighboring C nucleotides, which would otherwise be edited with similar efficiency, and doubled the number of disease-associated target Cs able to be corrected preferentially over nearby non-target Cs.},

abstract = {CRISPR-Cas9 systems provide a platform for high efficiency genome editing that are enabling innovative applications of mammalian cell engineering. However, the delivery of Cas9 and synthesis of guide RNA (gRNA) remain as steps that can limit overall efficiency and ease of use. Here we describe methods for rapid synthesis of gRNA and for delivery of Cas9 protein/gRNA ribonucleoprotein complexes (Cas9 RNPs) into a variety of mammalian cells through liposome-mediated transfection or electroporation. Using these methods, we report nuclease-mediated indel rates of up to 94% in Jurkat T cells and 87% in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) for a single target. When we used this approach for multigene targeting in Jurkat cells we found that two-locus and three-locus indels were achieved in approximately 93% and 65% of the resulting isolated cell lines, respectively. Further, we found that the off-target cleavage rate is reduced using Cas9 protein when compared to plasmid DNA transfection. Taken together, we present a streamlined cell engineering workflow that enables gRNA design to analysis of edited cells in as little as four days and results in highly efficient genome modulation in hard-to-transfect cells. The reagent preparation and delivery to cells is amenable to high throughput, multiplexed genome-wide cell engineering.},

CRISPR-Cas system is very efficient, fast, easy and cheap technique for achieving knock-out gene in the cell. CRISPR-Cas9 system refurbishes the targeted genome editing approach into a more expedient and competent way, thus facilitating proficient genome editing through embattled double-strand breaks in approximately any organism and cell type. The off-target effects of CRISPR Cas system has been circumnavigated by using paired nickases. Moreover, CRISPR-Cas9 has been used effectively for numerous purposes, like knock-out of a gene, regulation of endogenous gene expression, live-cell labelling of chromosomal loci, edition of single-stranded RNA and high-throughput gene screening. The execution of the CRISPR-Cas9 system has amplified the number of accessible scientific substitutes for studying gene function, thus enabling generation of CRISPR-based disease models. Even though many mechanistic questions are left behind to be answered and the system is not yet fool-proof i.e., a number of challenges are yet to be addressed, the employment of CRISPR-Cas9–based genome engineering technologies will increase our understanding to disease processes and their treatment in the near future. In this review we have discussed the history of CRISPR-Cas9, its mechanism for genome editing and its application in animal, plant and protozoan parasites. Additionally, the pros and cons of CRISPR-Cas9 and its potential in therapeutic application have also been detailed here.},

In this study, adeno-associated virus was used to deliver the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 system to the mdx mousemodel of DMD to remove the mutated exon 23 from the dystrophin gene. This includes local and systemic delivery to adult mice and systemic delivery to neonatal mice.

abstract = {The CRISPR-Cas9 system uses guide RNAs to direct the Cas9 endonuclease to cleave target sequences. It can, in theory, target essentially any sequence in a genome, but the efficiency of the predicted guide RNAs varies dramatically. If no targeted cells are obtained, it is also difficult to know why the experiment fails. We have developed a transient transfection based method to enrich successfully targeted cells by co-targeting the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) gene. Cells are transfected with two guide RNAs that target respectively HPRT and the gene of interest. HPRT targeted cells are selected by resistance to 6-thioguanine (6-TG) and then examined for potential alterations to the gene targeted by the co-transfected guide RNA. Alterations of many genes, such as AAVS1, Exo1 and Trex1, are highly enriched in the 6-TG resistant cells. This method works in both HCT116 cells and U2OS cells and can easily be scaled up to process multiple guide RNAs. When co-targeting fails, it is straightforward to determine whether the target gene is essential or the guide RNA is ineffective. HPRT co-targeting thus provides a simple, efficient and scalable way to enrich gene targeting events and to identify the cause of failure.},

Here, we describe an approach that combines a Cas9 nickase mutant with paired guide RNAs to introduce targeted double-strand breaks. Because individual nicks in the genome are repaired with high fidelity, simultaneous nicking via appropriately offset guide RNAs is required for double-stranded breaks and extends the number of specifically recognized bases for target cleavage. We demonstrate that using paired nicking can reduce off-target activity by 50- to 1,500-fold in cell lines and to facilitate gene knockout in mouse zygotes without sacrificing on-target cleavage efficiency.

Then, the efficacy of transformation was compared between the three-mentioned methods. Results Ampicillin-induced spheroplasts from early-log phase culture of brucella when incubated in a medium-containing 0.2 M sucrose during cell recovery had higher transformation efficiency in three different methods. Comparison of the transformation efficiency of Brucella abortus RB51 using the CaCl2, lipofection, and electroporation methods revealed that the transformation efficiency with the lipofection method was significantly higher than with other two methods (P < 0.05). Conclusions Lipofection method by lipofectamine 2000 on ampicillin-induced spheroplasts can be a suitable approach for Brucella transformation.},
